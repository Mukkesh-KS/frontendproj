    Skydiving is an extreme sport where a person jumps from an aircraft and free-falls before deploying a parachute. It offers an intense adrenaline rush and a breathtaking view of the earth from above. The experience blends fear, thrill, and freedom into a few unforgettable moments. Skydiving is often done for recreation, adventure, or even competitive sport. Safety training and proper equipment are essential for every jump</p>
